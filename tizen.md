OSG, OCF, & An Automotive Fortnight!

The Samsung Open Source Group is playing an active role in the promotion and adoption of IoT standards across multiple domains. Samsung understands the importance of openness and collaboration to realize the full potential of IoT. One of the key promises we’ve made,  is to be open and collaborative in our approach to delivering products and solutions to our customers. This was a core part of the Samsung strategy, as explained in the following video.

Samsung has remain committed to this approach and continued to deliver on the promise, year after year.

Based on these principles the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF), a global consortium of leading companies (~170 and growing) focused on creating a standard for interoperable devices and services was founded in 2014. The OCF approach has three key deliverables:

    An Open Specification: Open Connectivity Foundation
    An Open Source Implementation: IoTivity
    A membership driven certification program:  OCF certification

Through this approach, OCF has created an ecosystem where device manufacturers, IT service providers, and application developers can target their existing devices, services, and apps to a massive potential consumer base. This program has continued to gain more members and build momentum. Automotive is one key target of OCF and IoTivity, and the Open Source Group has been busy solving some important issues in this domain.

This post will cover a handful of presentations we’ve given recently to help spread the message. For some context, check out our overview of some of our recent activities with IoTivity and automotive functionality.
GENIVI & OCF Demo

A demonstration of GENIVI and OCF was presented at the recent GENIVI all member meeting in Paris. This technical session demonstrated how IoTivity can be used to connect automotive systems to OCF devices. This was a joint effort between Jaguar Land Rover, GENIVI, and Samsung.

Technical talk at the AGL AMM in Japan, 2016

Another talk worth mentioning is one given at the Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) All Members Meeting (AMM) that was held last February in Tokyo, Japan. It describes plans in the community to provide OCF support to a Yocto-based system.

How to: IoTivity on Tizen presented at OpenIoT 2016

The combination of Tizen, IoTivity, and Yocto is proving to be a very powerful platform for building a wide range of consumer devices. Some hints were shared about IoTivity integration on commercialized Tizen devices with Tizen:IVI at OpenIoT in San Diego, CA.

CampOSV: First Vehicle Hackathon, Rennes France

CampOSV is a community event in Rennes, France about what can be done on open R&D platforms. We demonstrated how Tizen and IoTivity can be used to create a “libre, connected car” through a proof of concept.

OSIS2016 : Open Source Innovation Spring at IoT day, Paris

Philippe gave a talk at IoT Day in Paris, France about using IoTivity and Tizen to create IoT devices and prototypes using the RaspberryPI Zero. This talk offered more technical details about creating a GPS map that integrated a smart watch with an in-car dash.

Conclusion

The overall goal of these activities is for Samsung to examine the multiple approaches for collaboration with existing open source communities and distributions in the automotive space. GENIVI and AGL have built incredible communities that follow different approaches, and as part of expanding OCF into the automotive domain we would like to bring OCF and IoTivity to interested members in both of these communities. We’d like people to consider the adoption of an IoT standard that will be mutually beneficial to both OCF and the open source automotive pioneers. In the coming weeks we will be submitting patches into public repositories of GENIVI and Automotive Grade Linux, for these demos.

We have received tremendous response from a broad technical community including W3C, Genivi and AGL members and will continue to collaborate going further. We encourage you to checkout the information and links and let us know if you’re interested in collaborating with us.
